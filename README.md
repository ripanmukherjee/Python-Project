This repository is having different project written in python

## Content

1. project-1-word-cloud : For this project, we'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

2. project-2-report-generation-from-log-file : Log Analysis Using Regular Expressions. The service's developers need help getting some information from some logs so that they can better understand how their software is used and how to improve it. So, for this project, we'll write some automation scripts that will process the system log and generate reports based on the information extracted from the log files.

3. project-3-validation-name : Python scripts that check the first char of the usename and return 'True' if first char is letter and 'False' otherwise.

4. project-4-calculator-python : Python scrips that use tkinter module to create a calculator application"

5. project-5-subprocess-rsync : Python scripts that use subprocess and multiprocessing module to move the file from one directory to another directory by using rsync process. And also this scitps use multiprocessing to do process in parallel. os.wait module has used which generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. This is used to traverse the file system in Python.

6. project-6-improving-python-code : Python scripts that download csv file from website directly and store the data into list. Later import that list to csv via csv reader and then do bunch of activity such as check the employee's joining date and print a report as per user input start date.
