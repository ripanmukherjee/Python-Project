## Content
1. project-1-word-cloud : For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.

2. project-2-report-generation-from-log-file : Log Analysis Using Regular Expressions. The service's developers need help getting some information from some logs so that they can better understand how their software is used and how to improve it. So, for this project, we'll write some automation scripts that will process the system log and generate reports based on the information extracted from the log files.
